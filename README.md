# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is concept of binding or grouping the data member and member functions in to a single unit.

# Data Hiding
Data and encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class. The data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions which are wrapped in the class can access it. These functions provide the interface between the objectâ€™s data and the program. This insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding. Data Hiding is concept of protecting the data member and member function from access of outside the class. In other words we can not access the data member and member functions outside the class. Data hiding can be controlled using the access modifiers that prefix the class name, method and fields 

# Abstraction 
It's refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanation. 

# Inheritance 
It's the process by which objects of one class acquired the properties of objects of another classes. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. In OOP, the concept of inheritance provides the idea of reusability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it


# Polymorphism
It's is another important OOP concept. Polymorphism, a Greek term, means the ability to take more than one form. 
An operation may exhibit different behavior is different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation.
For example, consider the operation of addition. For two numbers, the operation will generate a sum. If the operands are strings, then the operation would produce a third string by concatenation. The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as operator overloading.
