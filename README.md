Encapsulation
Encapsulation is concept of binding or grouping the data member and member functions in to a single unit.

Data Hiding
Data and encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class. The data is not accessible to the outside world, 
and only those functions which are wrapped in the class can access it. 
These functions provide the interface between the objectâ€™s data and the program. 
This insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding. 
Data Hiding is concept of protecting the data member and member function from access of outside the class. 
In other words we can not access the data member and member functions outside the class. 
Data hiding can be controlled using the access modifiers that prefix the class name, method and fields
